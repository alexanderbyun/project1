                <h4 class = "flex-cont3b-text">Hi there! My interest in coding started in my senior year of high school, where I took a web design class that mainly covered HTML and CSS. I had a great time then, but that was all the way back in 2010. <br><br>
                Over these past 12 formative years, wherever I went, I found great satisfaction is leaving things better than I found them. Whether it was changing the lightbulbs to be the same color temperature, or streamlining a company's workflow for critial processes, I always try to find a way to leave a positive impact.
                <br><br>
                Now, as the technological advancements continue to grow exponentially, I want to learn the skills to create the digital solutions to our real-world problems. With my team running three-deep, I aim to help improve the daily lives of my family, friends, peers, and all other fellow earth-dwellers.
                <br><br>
                Check out my support team below.
