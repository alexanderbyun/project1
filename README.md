==Index==
Menu is set to change color on hover (user interaction 1).
Footer social media links are set to turn slightly opaque on hover. Links also will open in a new tab. Footer section was intially copied and pasted across all four .html files, but updated to just be written in jQuery once and appended on all the .html files at the same time.
Body was just some light introductory text, played with different font sizes. Formatted using FlexBox.
Smartphone mode set to kick in at 700px.

==About==
Formatting the FlexBox to have bio info and my picture took some trial and error. I wish the picture could be a bit bigger, but I'm happy with where it's at.
Carousel was challenging to incorporate. Something may have been off on my notes, had to re-watch the lecture and completely re-write it after a couple hours of debugging. (user interaction 2)

==Projects==
Utilized modals to display further detail with a link to the Git for each project. I wanted to do more, but it took a long time so I capped it at two projects. (user interaction 3)

==Resume==
Contemplated making a collapsible structure, with the bullet points being the toggled information, but I did not have time to learn and implement it effectively. 

==Other==
Everything took longer than I anticipated. Nothing worked the first time around, and getting started was the hardest.
